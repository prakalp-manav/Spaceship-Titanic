# Spaceship Titanic Kaggle Competition

Welcome to the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle competition! This competition challenges participants to predict the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Spaceship Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more.

## Competition Objective

The objective of this competition is to build machine learning models that can accurately predict whether a passenger survived or not during the Titanic disaster. Participants are provided with a training dataset containing features such as:

1. Passenger Class

2. Name

3. Sex

4. Age

5. Siblings/Spouses Aboard

6. Parents/Children Aboard

7. Ticket Number

8. Fare

9. Cabin

10. Port of Embarkation

## Evaluation Metric

Submissions are evaluated based on their accuracy in predicting passenger survival. The evaluation metric for this competition is typically accuracy, i.e., the percentage of correctly predicted outcomes.
